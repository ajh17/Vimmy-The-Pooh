    Piglet: "Oh Pooh, we will be friends forever, won't we?"

    Vimmy the Pooh: "Even longer"

    "Before beginning a Search, it is wise to ask Vim what you
     are looking for before you begin looking for it."
       - Vimmy the Pooh

    "Reading :help, asking #vim, makes all the difference."
        - Vimmy the Pooh

    "I wonder what #vim is doing," thought Vimmy the Pooh,
    "I wish I were there to be doing it, too."

    "If you want to make a file more Vimmy, add a few tiddely :wq"

    "When you first wake up in the morning, Pooh," said Piglet, "what's the
    first thing you say to yourself?"

    "What new Vim tip am I going to learn today" said Vimmy the Pooh. "What do
    you say, Piglet?"

    "I say, I wonder what's going to happen exciting today?" said Piglet.

    Vimmy the Pooh nodded thoughtfully. "It's the same thing," he said.

.

    "And if anyone knows anything about anything, it's :help
    who knows something about something, or my name's not Vimmy
    the Pooh. Which it is. So there you are."
